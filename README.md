### Hypothesis: 
Poverty will be more concentrated in East Austin in 2015 than the rest of the city, and as time goes on the poverty level in East Austin will decrease as gentrification pushes people out of Austin altogether. 

### Definition: 
East Austin: zip codes: 78721, 78702, 78722, 78723 (east of 35, south of Mueller, north of Riverside, west of 183)

### Data Topics:
1. How have income and house values changed over time in both Austin as a whole and in East Austin? 
2. Is there more Section 8/affordable housing in East Austin compared to the city as a whole, and is the number of units increasing in East Austin? 
3. What does the school data â€“ ethnicity/race, STAAR scores, enrollment, free and reduced lunch - say about poverty in East Austin?
4. What permits are issued by the city and what do they indicate about poverty in East Austin?
