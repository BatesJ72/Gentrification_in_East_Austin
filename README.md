# Gentrification in East Austin from 2015-2019

## Hypothesis: 
Poverty will be more concentrated in East Austin in 2015 as compared to the rest of the city, and as time goes on, the poverty level in East Austin will decrease as gentrification pushes people out of Austin altogether.

### Our Questions (i.e. measures of gentrification):
1. How have income and house values changed over time? 
2. Is there more Section 8 housing (government assisted housing) in East Austin, and is the number of units increasing? 
3. What does the school data say about poverty in East Austin?
4. What permits are issued by the city and what do they indicate about poverty in East Austin?

### Definition of East Austin:

#### House Values

According to the data, East Austin and Austin as a whole has experienced an increase in average home value. When looking specifically at East Austin, we see some of the largest growth in the area that far outpaces the national average for increase in home value. In relation to our hypothesis and according to the data, it appears poverty in East Austin has been pushed out almost entirely.

#### School data: Ethnicity and Academic Performance

##### Ethnic Distribution: 
The Hispanic/Latino ethnic group, which has traditionally formed the majority in East Austin schools, showed a 5% decline in enrollment in these 5 years. There was an accompanying 5% rise in the White student population. Both trends deviate from other Travis County schools, and indicate a demographic shift in East Austin.

##### Academic Performance (STAAR test results): 
White students show significant improvement in academic performance compared to others over these 5 years, indicating a shift in the local White population in East Austin. This could be a possible outcome of kids from higher income households with access to better support and more resources coming into schools in the area (assuming at least some join the public school system in AISD).

The above findings indicate that certain ethnic groups are getting pushed out of East Austin over time -- thus, partially supporting our initial hypothesis of gentrification in the East Austin neighborhood.

## Conclusion

There is more poverty on the east side when looking at some aspects: The house prices are lower on the east side than the rest of the city and east of 35 there are more low income students in schools. However, there is not a higher concentration of Section 8 housing on the east side, which disproves the hypothesis. 

There are many aspects that show evidence of gentrification: House prices in east Austin are increasing, certain ethnic groups are being pushed out and (probable) higher income households and ethnicities are replacing them, Section 8 housing is being pushed to the outskirts of the city, and there is an increased amount of residential construction permits. However, there is not a decline in schools for students who are in low income households on the east side and commercial construction permits have decreased, which disproves the hypothesis.

#### Limitations of Our Data
1. Free and reduced lunch data was not available for 2014 - 2015 school year.
2. The school data was structured in terms of school years (August to May), but the other data was structured traditionally (January to December).
3. No relavant data was available for zipcode 78762, a small area embedded within 78702.
